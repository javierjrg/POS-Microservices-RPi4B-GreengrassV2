Description:
	This Python script checks if a local file (counter.csv) exists at the specified path, 
	and if so, attempts to upload it to a predefined AWS S3 bucket (ggc-project-s3-bucket) using boto3; 
	it handles AWS operations and file handling errors, providing feedback on success or failure.

  You need to upload this code to your S3 bucket.
