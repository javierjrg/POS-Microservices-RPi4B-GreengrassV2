# Seamless Point of Sale Operations: Deploying Cloud-Native Microservices on Raspberry Pi 4B with AWS Greengrass V2

### Ensuring Seamless Data Flow Between Raspberry Pi 4B and AWS Greengrass V2

---

## Project Description
This project focuses on deploying a cloud-native microservices architecture on a Raspberry Pi 4B (RPi4B) using AWS Greengrass V2 to enhance the operational efficiency of point-of-sale (POS) systems. By leveraging AWS Greengrass V2, the project enables offline capabilities for POS devices, allowing them to function seamlessly even during network outages. This deployment reduces latency and ensures a reliable local processing environment, supporting uninterrupted customer service.

The architecture incorporates secure local data processing, with all transactions recorded locally and synchronized to the cloud upon reconnection. This setup optimizes performance during connectivity disruptions and enhances the system's reliability. Key features include:

- **Local Microservices Deployment:** AWS Greengrass V2 runs essential services directly on the Raspberry Pi 4B, minimizing reliance on constant cloud connectivity.
- **Offline Functionality:** POS devices continue operating during network failures, ensuring an improved user experience.
- **Data Synchronization:** Automatic synchronization of locally processed data to AWS once connectivity is restored, maintaining data integrity and continuity.
- **Enhanced Security:** To protect sensitive transaction data, robust security measures, including encryption and access controls, have been implemented.

This project addresses critical challenges in current POS systems, such as performance slowdowns during outages, by providing a scalable, reliable solution that meets the growing demands of modern retail environments.

## Architecture Overview
![Architecture Diagram](Pictures/GreengrassProjectDiagram.jpg)

This project leverages AWS Greengrass V2 to deploy a cloud-native microservices architecture on a Raspberry Pi 4B, enabling seamless offline operations for POS devices. The architecture consists of the following key components:

1. **Raspberry Pi 4B:** Acts as the local processing hub, running AWS Greengrass and hosting microservices that enable POS operations even during network outages.
2. **AWS Greengrass V2:** Facilitates the deployment of microservices locally on the Raspberry Pi, ensuring that data processing can occur independently of cloud connectivity. It also manages secure communication between local devices and the cloud.
3. **Local Microservices:** These services, including the `s3_test1.py` script, handle POS transactions, update the `test.csv` file with transaction data, and synchronize with the cloud once internet connectivity is restored.
4. **Data Synchronization:** When the Raspberry Pi regains internet access, it automatically uploads locally stored data to a specified S3 bucket, ensuring all transactions are recorded for further analysis or reporting.
5. **Cloud Integration:** Although only partially utilized at this stage, the architecture is designed to easily integrate with AWS services (like DynamoDB) for future data storage and analytics capabilities.

This architecture enables improved reliability, reduced latency, and secure local processing, providing a robust solution for POS operations in environments with unstable internet connectivity.
